# 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

## 1. 🟦 Node.js (TypeScript)

### 🔧 What is it?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime for building scalable backend services. Combined with TypeScript, it offers static type checking and rich developer tooling.

### ✨ Why use it?

- Asynchronous & event-driven
- Type safety and better tooling with TypeScript
- Extensive ecosystem (npm)

### ✅ Advantages

- Fast execution with the V8 engine
- TypeScript improves developer productivity and reduces bugs
- Large community support

---

## 2. 🚂 Express.js

### 🔧 What is it?

A minimal and flexible Node.js web framework for building RESTful APIs.

### ✨ Why use it?

- Lightweight and quick to set up
- Built-in middleware support (authentication, validation, etc.)

### ✅ Advantages

- Simple and effective routing system
- Robust middleware ecosystem
- Great for both microservices and monoliths

---

## 3. 🧱 Helmet

### 🔧 What is it?

Helmet sets various HTTP headers to secure Express apps.

### ✨ Why use it?

- Reduces common security vulnerabilities (clickjacking, MIME sniffing, etc.)

### ✅ Advantages

- Automatically handles critical security headers
- Customizable configuration
- Plug-and-play protection

---

## 4. 🛡️ XSS-Clean

### 🔧 What is it?

Middleware to sanitize user input and prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

### ✨ Why use it?

- Ensures user inputs are safe
- Blocks injection-based attacks

### ✅ Advantages

- Lightweight and efficient
- Automatic input sanitation
- Easily integrates with Express

---

## 5. 🔐 JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

### 🔧 What is it?

A secure, compact method for transmitting user identity between frontend and backend.

### ✨ Why use it?

- Stateless authentication mechanism
- Easy integration with REST APIs

### ✅ Advantages

- Tamper-proof and secure tokens
- Eliminates the need for server-side sessions
- Works well with mobile and SPA applications

---

## 6. 📬 Nodemailer

### 🔧 What is it?

A module for sending emails from Node.js (e.g., for OTPs or verifications).

### ✨ Why use it?

- Supports account verification, welcome emails, password resets, etc.

### ✅ Advantages

- Supports SMTP, Gmail, SendGrid, etc.
- Works with both HTML and text email templates
- Simple and reliable

---

## 7. 🧩 Drizzle ORM

### 🔧 What is it?

A modern TypeScript-first ORM for working with SQL databases.

### ✨ Why use it?

- Define schema and migrations in code
- Lightweight and TypeScript-native

### ✅ Advantages

- Fully typesafe database interactions
- Easy migrations and version control
- Perfect fit for TypeScript projects

---

## 8. 🐘 PostgreSQL

### 🔧 What is it?

A powerful, open-source relational database system.

### ✨ Why use it?

- ACID-compliant and robust
- Advanced querying capabilities (joins, JSON, full-text search)
- Seamless integration with Drizzle ORM

### ✅ Advantages

- Strong consistency and integrity
- High performance and indexing support
- Scalable and reliable for large apps
